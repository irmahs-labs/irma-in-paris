# CLAUDE.md

<!-- The sections down to "Checks before pushing" are the same in every
irmahs-labs repo; change them in irmahs-labs/template first. Replace the
examples and the sections after it for this app. -->

## Git branches

Always pull before making changes: run `git fetch origin` and start from the latest `origin/main` before the first edit.

- On a branch whose PR is open, bring it up to date with `origin/main` first
- On `main`, or on a branch whose PR is already merged, create a new branch from `origin/main` instead

Always name the branch after the feature or fix it contains, never a random or generated name.

- Format: `<type>/<feature-name>` in lowercase kebab-case
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`
- Examples: `feat/contact-form`, `fix/dark-mode-contrast`, `docs/claude-md`
- If the session assigns a generic branch (for example `claude/<random-words>`), create a feature-named branch instead and push there

## Pull requests

- Never push to `main`. Every change goes in through a pull request.
- Open the PR and stop there: never merge it, not even when CI is green. Irma reviews and clicks merge.
- Deploys run on merge to `main`. Re-run a deploy only when Irma asks.

## Checks before pushing

```sh
npm run check      # Ultracite (oxlint + oxfmt); CI fails on it
npm run typecheck
npm test           # vitest
npm run build
```

The PostToolUse hook in `.claude/hooks/ultracite.sh` runs Ultracite and the typecheck on every file you edit.

## What this is

What the app is, where it runs (`<name>.irmahs.dev`), and what it is built with.

## Design

Apps use Cute Matcha's app look (the _Apps_ section of Irma's Cute Matcha design system), in both of its themes, with colours from its role tokens. Say here which parts of the app follow it and how.
